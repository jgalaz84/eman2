/** df3 file format (http://www.povray.org/documentation/view/3.6.1/374)
 * Header:
 * The df3 format consists of a 6 byte header of three 16-bit integers with
 * high order byte first. These three values give the x,y,z size of the data
 * in pixels (or more appropriately called voxels ).
 * Data:
 * The header is followed by x*y*z unsigned integer bytes of data with a
 * resolution of 8, 16 or 32 bit. The data are written with high order byte
 * first (big-endian). The resolution of the data is determined by the size
 * of the df3-file. That is, if the file is twice (minus header, of course)
 * as long as an 8 bit file then it is assumed to contain 16 bit ints and
 * if it is four times as long 32 bit ints.
