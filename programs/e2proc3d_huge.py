	This is a specialized version of e2proc3d.py targeted at performing a limited set of operations on
very large volumes in-place (such as tomograms) which may not readily fit into system memory. Operations are 
performed by reading portions of the image, processing, then writing the portion back to disk. Unlike e2proc3d.py
you may pass only a single operation to the program for each invocation, or behavior will be undefined. It will 
process a single volume in a single file in-place.
